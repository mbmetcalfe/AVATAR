;; This file shows the sort of things required in the character definition
;; files. Basically anything that is personal to you, and specific to a
;; character should go here, rather than in the tiny.personalise.
;; Primaraliy, it's good for gear definitions, but also for character specific
;; messages, triggers, etc.

;; Usage:
;;      /<current geat set>2<new gear set>
/cleangear

/set main_bag "floating icesphere loot"

;;; load lord ac gearset
/load -q char/lord.ac2.ava.tf
;;; load lord det gearset
/load -q char/lord.det.ava.tf
;;; load lord hit gearset
/load -q char/lord.hit1.ava.tf
