;; This file shows the sort of things required in the character definition
;; files. Basically anything that is personal to you, and specific to a 
;; character should go here, rather than in the tiny.personalise.
;; Primaraliy, it's good for gear definitions, but also for character specific
;; messages, triggers, etc.
